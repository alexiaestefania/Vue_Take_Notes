# Take Notes!

A simple app to create and view notes. Made with Vue 3 and Bulma.
You can write down a note by pressing the "new notes" button. It will be saved to local storage, and displayed in the page. Until you clear the browser cache, your notes will remain stored there.
Inspired by the notes app from Laith Academy's YouTube video - The Ultimate Vue 3 Tutorial (100% Composition API)
